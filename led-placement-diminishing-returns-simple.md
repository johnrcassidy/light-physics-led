## Quick Summary

**The main idea**: LED lights work best when they're close to your plants. The further away they are, the less light your plants get.

**The simple rule**: If you double the distance, you get only one-quarter of the light.

## What You Need to Know

### LED Lights

**The Problem**: 
- LED lights are like flashlights - they shine in one direction
- The further away they are, the more the light spreads out
- Spread out light = weaker light for your plants

**How Light Diminishes** (Inverse Square Law):
- **At 1 meter**: Reference intensity (call this 100%)
- **At 2 meters**: 25% of the 1-meter value
- **At 3 meters**: 11% of the 1-meter value
- **At 4 meters**: 6.25% of the 1-meter value

**The Rule**: Every time you double the distance, you get only **one-quarter** of the light.

**What This Means**:
- If your LEDs are too high, your plants won't get enough light
- You'll waste electricity and money
- Your plants won't grow as well

**The Solution**:
- Keep LEDs as close to your plants as practical
- Don't hang them too high
- Move the lights closer, not the plants further away

### Natural Sunlight

**The Good News**:
- Natural sunlight from the sun works completely differently
- The sun is so far away (150 million kilometers!) that moving your plants a few meters makes no difference at all
- Whether your plants are 1 meter or 4 meters from the ground, they get the same sunlight

**What This Means**:
- You don't need to worry about plant height affecting natural sunlight
- The sun is already so far away that small changes don't matter

## Visual Examples

### LED Light (Inverse Square Law)
```
LED Light
   │
   │ 1m → 100% (reference)
   │
   │ 2m → 25%
   │
   │ 3m → 11%
   │
   │ 4m → 6.25%

```

### Natural Sunlight
```
Sun (150 million km away)
   │
   │ Distance doesn't change
   │
   ▼
Plants ← Full sunlight (height doesn't matter)
```

## Practical Tips

### ✅ Do This:
- Keep LED lights as close to your plants as practical
- Check your light height regularly
- Adjust LED height as plants grow
- Use natural sunlight when possible (it's free!)

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Hang LEDs too high (you'll waste light and money)
- Think moving plants will fix LED distance problems
- Assume all light works the same way

## Why This Happens

**Simple Explanation**:
- Light spreads out in all directions (like a balloon getting bigger)
- When you double the distance, the light has to cover 4 times the area
- Same amount of light spread over 4 times the area = 1/4 the strength

**Real-World Comparison**:
- Think of spraying paint from a can
- Close up: thick paint on a small area
- Far away: thin paint spread over a big area
- Same amount of paint, but much thinner when spread out

## Quick Reference

| Distance | Relative to 1m | Calculation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1m       | 100% (reference) | 1/(1)² = 1 |
| 2m       | 25%            | 1/(2)² = 0.25 |
| 3m       | 11%            | 1/(3)² = 0.11 |
| 4m       | 6.25%          | 1/(4)² = 0.0625 |

**The Formula**: Intensity ∝ 1/distance²

**Key Insight**: Halving the distance gives you 4× the light; doubling the distance gives you only ¼ the light.

---

## Bottom Line

**For LED Lights**:
- Distance matters a lot
- Closer = better light = better growth
- Double the distance = quarter the light (inverse square law)

**For Natural Sunlight**:
- Distance doesn't matter
- Plant height won't affect sunlight
- The sun is already so far away

**Key Takeaway**: 
LED placement is important. Natural sunlight placement isn't. Keep your LEDs close to get the most out of them.

## Need Help?

If you're not sure about your LED placement:
1. Measure the distance from your LEDs to your plants
2. Use the reference table to see relative intensity at that distance
3. Remember: halving the distance quadruples the light intensity
