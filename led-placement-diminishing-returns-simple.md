## Quick Summary

**The main idea**: LED lights work best when they're close to your plants. The further away they are, the less light your plants get.

**The simple rule**: If you double the distance, you get only one-quarter of the light.

## What You Need to Know

### LED Lights

**The Problem**: 
- LED lights are like torches - they shine in one direction
- The further away they are, the more the light spreads out
- Spread out light = weaker light for your plants

**How Light Diminishes** (Inverse Square Law):

The **reference distance** is the distance from the LED to the nearest shelf - this is your baseline (100%).

- **At reference distance**: 100% intensity (baseline)
- **At 2× reference**: 25% of baseline
- **At 3× reference**: 11% of baseline
- **At 4× reference**: 6.25% of baseline

**The Rule**: Every time you double the distance from your baseline, you get only **one-quarter** of the light.

**What This Means**:
- If your LEDs are too high, your plants won't get enough light
- You'll waste electricity and money
- Your plants won't grow as well

**The Solution**:
- Keep LEDs as close to your plants as practical
- Don't hang them too high
- Move the lights closer, not the plants further away

### Natural Sunlight

**The Good News**:
- Natural sunlight from the sun works completely differently
- The sun is so far away (150 million kilometres!) that moving your plants a few metres makes no difference at all
- Whether your plants are 1 metre or 4 metres from the ground, they get the same sunlight

**What This Means**:
- You don't need to worry about plant height affecting natural sunlight
- The sun is already so far away that small changes don't matter

## Visual Examples

### LED Light (Inverse Square Law)
```
LED Light
   │
   │ 1m → 100% (reference)
   │
   │ 2m → 25%
   │
   │ 3m → 11%
   │
   │ 4m → 6.25%
   ▼
```

### Natural Sunlight
```
Sun (150 million km away)
   │
   │ Distance doesn't change
   │
   ▼
Plants ← Full sunlight (height doesn't matter)
```

---

## Practical Tips

### ✅ Do This:
- Keep LED lights as close to your plants as practical
- Check your light height regularly
- Adjust LED height as plants grow
- Use natural sunlight when possible (it's free!)

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Hang LEDs too high (you'll waste light and money)
- Think moving plants will fix LED distance problems
- Assume all light works the same way

---

## Why This Happens

**Simple Explanation**:
- Light spreads out in all directions (like a balloon getting bigger)
- When you double the distance, the light has to cover 4 times the area
- Same amount of light spread over 4 times the area = 1/4 the strength

**Real-World Comparison**:
- Think of spraying paint from a can
- Close up: thick paint on a small area
- Far away: thin paint spread over a big area
- Same amount of paint, but much thinner when spread out

---

## Quick Reference

| Distance | Relative to 1m | Calculation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1m       | 100% (reference) | 1/(1)² = 1 |
| 2m       | 25%            | 1/(2)² = 0.25 |
| 3m       | 11%            | 1/(3)² = 0.11 |
| 4m       | 6.25%          | 1/(4)² = 0.0625 |

**The Formula**: Intensity ∝ 1/distance²

**Key Insight**: Halving the distance gives you 4× the light; doubling the distance gives you only ¼ the light.

## Glasshouse Vertical Growing: What You Need to Know

In a glasshouse with vertical shelving, light becomes complicated. Unlike open fields, you're dealing with structures, seasons, and multiple growing levels.

### The Sun Moves - Your Light Changes

**Throughout the Year**:
- **Summer solstice** (June 21): Sun is highest in the sky (~62° at UK latitudes)
- **Winter solstice** (December 21): Sun is lowest (~15° at UK latitudes)
- **Equinoxes** (March 21, September 21): Sun at middle height (~38°)

**What This Means**:
- In summer, light comes from almost directly overhead
- In winter, light comes in at a low angle through the sides
- Your shelves receive very different light depending on the season

### The A-Frame Shading Problem

A typical 4-metre A-frame structure creates shadows that extend across the floor.

```
SIDE VIEW (looking from the east or west):

Summer (high sun):              Winter (low sun):
      ☀️ (62°)                        ☀️ (15°)
        \                               \
         \                               \
    ┌─────┐                         ┌─────┐
    │  A  │                         │  A  │
    │frame│                         │frame│
    └─────┘                         └─────┘
      ▓▓ ← Short shadow               ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ← Long shadow
    ══════════════════            ══════════════════════════════
         Floor                              Floor
```

**Shadow length from a 4m structure** (measured along floor from base):
- Summer (62° sun): ~2m shadow
- Equinox (38° sun): ~5m shadow
- Winter (15° sun): ~15m shadow

### Multi-Level Shelving: Each Level is Different

A typical vertical growing setup has 4 shelf levels with different configurations:

```
SIDE VIEW (cross-section, looking from the south):

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Shelf 4 (Double)  │  EAST  │  WEST  │ ← Top level  │
│                   │ facing │ facing │   Most light │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Shelf 3 (Double)  │  EAST  │  WEST  │ ← Upper-mid  │
│                   │ facing │ facing │   Good light │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Shelf 2 (Single)  │        │        │ ← Lower-mid  │
│                   │ centre │        │   Mod. light │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Shelf 1 (Single)  │        │        │ ← Bottom     │
│                   │ centre │        │   Low light  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
                        Floor
```

**Shelf Configuration**:
- **Shelves 1 & 2**: Single aspect (centre-facing)
- **Shelves 3 & 4**: Double aspect (east-facing and west-facing sides)

**The Reality**:
- Shelf 4: May get 100% available light (both E and W aspects)
- Shelf 3: 60-80% (shaded by Shelf 4 above)
- Shelf 2: 30-50% (cumulative shading)
- Shelf 1: 10-25% (severe light limitation)

**East vs West Aspects**:
- **East-facing**: Morning sun, cooler afternoon shade
- **West-facing**: Afternoon sun, morning shade
- Light levels differ throughout the day on double shelves

### Shade Avoidance Response

Plants know when they're being shaded. They respond by:
- **Stretching** towards light (etiolation)
- **Thinner leaves** to capture more light
- **Reduced flowering** and fruiting
- **Pale, weak growth**

This is called the **shade avoidance response** - plants waste energy trying to outgrow their neighbours instead of producing fruit.

### ePAR: The Light Plants Actually Use

**What is ePAR?**
- ePAR = Extended Photosynthetically Active Radiation
- The wavelengths plants use: **400-750nm** (visible light plus far-red)
- Measured in **µmol/m²/s** (micromoles per square metre per second)

**Target ePAR Ranges**:

| Crop Type | ePAR Range (µmol/m²/s) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Leafy greens | 200-400 |
| Herbs | 300-500 |
| Tomatoes, peppers | 400-600 |
| High-light crops | 600-1000+ |

**Below minimum ePAR**: Poor growth, weak plants, low yields
**Above maximum ePAR**: Wasted energy, potential light stress

### Why ePAR Sensors Are Critical

**You cannot guess light levels.** You must measure them.

**Recommended Sensor**: Apogee ePAR sensors measure the full extended PAR range (400-750nm) that plants use for photosynthesis, providing accurate readings for horticultural applications.

**Without sensors, you're guessing**:
- How much light reaches each shelf?
- How does it change through the day?
- How does it change through the seasons?
- Are your LEDs actually helping?

**With sensors, you know**:
- Exact ePAR at each growing position
- When natural light is sufficient
- When to turn LEDs on/off
- Which shelves need supplemental lighting

### Misting and Fogging: The Hidden Light Blocker

Misting systems are essential for humidity and cooling, but they affect light in ways growers often overlook.

**What Happens When You Mist**:
```
Without mist:               With mist:
     ☀️                          ☀️
      │                           │
      │ (direct light)           ░░░ ← Water droplets
      │                          ░░░   scatter light
      ▼                           │
   Plants                        ▼
   (100% light)               Plants
                              (reduced light)
```

**How Mist Reduces Light**:
- Water droplets **scatter** incoming light in all directions
- Some light is **reflected** back upward, never reaching plants
- Fine mist creates a "fog" that blocks direct radiation
- Effect is worse with fine droplets (more surface area)

**The Impact**:
- Heavy misting can reduce PAR by **10-30%**
- Effect is temporary but cumulative over day
- Lower shelves affected more (light passes through multiple mist zones)

**Practical Advice**:
- Time misting for early morning or late afternoon when light is less critical
- Avoid misting during peak sunlight hours (10am-2pm)
- Use coarser droplets where possible (less scattering)
- Monitor PAR during misting cycles to understand actual impact
- Factor misting losses into your DLI calculations

### Simple Glasshouse Checklist

✅ **Measure first**: Install Apogee ePAR sensors before making decisions
✅ **Map your light**: Record ePAR at each shelf level, multiple times per day
✅ **Track seasons**: Light in July ≠ light in December
✅ **Match crops to light**: Put high-light crops on top shelves
✅ **Supplement strategically**: Use LEDs only where and when needed
✅ **Watch for shade avoidance**: Stretchy, pale plants = not enough light
✅ **Time your misting**: Avoid misting during peak light hours

---

## Bottom Line

**For LED Lights**:
- Distance matters a lot
- Closer = better light = better growth
- Double the distance = quarter the light (inverse square law)

**For Natural Sunlight**:
- Distance doesn't matter for intensity
- But angle, season, and structures change everything in a glasshouse

**For Glasshouse Vertical Growing**:
- Every shelf level is different - measure, don't assume
- Winter light ≠ summer light
- Apogee ePAR sensors are essential, not optional
- Match crops to available light at each position

**For Misting Systems**:
- Misting can reduce light by 10-30%
- Lower shelves are hit hardest (they rely on diffuse light)
- Time misting for early morning or late afternoon, not peak sunlight

**Key Takeaway**: 
You cannot manage what you do not measure. Install PAR sensors, map your light environment, and make data-driven decisions.

## Why the Sensor Head Matters: The Foundation of All Measurement

Every measurement in this document (ePAR, PPFD, DLI) depends entirely on one thing: **the sensor head**. Get this wrong, and everything that follows is unreliable.

### The Problem with Cheap Sensors

Many devices claim to measure PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density), but they actually:
- Use a **cheap lux sensor** internally
- Apply a **mathematical transform** to convert lux to PPFD
- The larger the reading, the greater the inaccuracy

**Why this matters**: Lux measures light as humans see it. PPFD measures light as plants use it. They are fundamentally different. A transform from one to the other is an approximation at best, and misleading at worst.

### What a True ePAR Sensor Does

A genuine ePAR sensor (like Apogee instruments) directly measures photons in the 400-750nm range, the wavelengths plants actually use. There is no conversion, no approximation.

**All other values derive from this primary measurement**:
- **DLI** (Daily Light Integral) = cumulative PAR photons hitting the sensor over a day
- **PPFD** (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) = density of PAR photons hitting a surface per second
- **PFD** (Photon Flux Density) = similar, with slight differences in frequency range

If your sensor head is inaccurate, every derived value is wrong.

### Data Alignment: Comparing Like with Like

When comparing measurements from different sources, you must know:
1. **What sensor head** is being used
2. **The accuracy, range, and resolution** from the technical datasheet (not marketing materials)
3. **Any conversion methods** applied to the raw data

Without this, you cannot compare readings meaningfully. A 10% error in the sensor becomes a 10% error in your DLI, your supplemental lighting decisions, and ultimately your yield predictions.

### Why Apogee Instruments

Apogee Instruments are world-class developers and manufacturers of sensing equipment in this specialist field. Their ePAR sensors:
- Directly measure photons (no lux conversion)
- Are designed by scientists for scientific accuracy
- Provide traceable calibration to known standards
- Include technical datasheets with stated accuracy, range, and resolution

### Sun vs LED: Different Measurement Challenges

Measuring PAR from the sun and from LEDs have different limiting factors:

| Source | Challenge | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Sun** | Angle of incidence changes throughout day | Sensor must have good cosine correction |
| **LEDs** | Point source with rapid intensity falloff | Distance to sensor is critical (inverse square law) |
| **Both** | Spectral composition varies | Sensor must cover full ePAR range (400-750nm) |

The common factor: **where the light source is relative to the target crop**. This is why sensor placement and sensor quality are inseparable from accurate measurement.

### The Bottom Line on Sensors

**You cannot manage what you do not measure accurately.**

Before trusting any light data:
1. Confirm the sensor head model and manufacturer
2. Obtain the technical datasheet (not marketing materials)
3. Understand the accuracy, range, and resolution
4. Know whether raw PAR is measured or transformed from lux
5. Check timestamp synchronisation if comparing multiple data sources

The sensor head is the foundation. Everything else (DLI calculations, LED scheduling, yield predictions) stands or falls on this foundation.

## Need Help?

If you're not sure about your LED placement:
1. Measure the distance from your LEDs to your plants
2. Use the reference table to see relative intensity at that distance
3. Remember: halving the distance quadruples the light intensity
